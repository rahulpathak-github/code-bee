Learn data structure and algorithms through creative visualizations and real-time doubt clearance.


The new Education policy 2021 has opened up the field of Computer Science to young coders. We realized that beginning with coding is tough for even a college-level beginner. Although there are a lot of free materials, everything that is organized is paid.


Also, the content is not designed for secondary school students. Therefore we came up with this innovation to provide students with free-of-cost study materials. Kids can learn logic, structure, sequence, and creative expression just as having fun around.
